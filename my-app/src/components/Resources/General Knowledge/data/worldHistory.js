This shift allowed for surplus food production, leading to population growth, the development of complex societal structures, specialized labor, trade networks, and governance systems. Mesopotamia, often called the 'Cradle of Civilization,' saw the development of early writing systems like cuneiform, while Egypt, flourishing along the Nile, is renowned for its monumental architecture such as pyramids and the Sphinx. The Indus Valley Civilization displayed advanced urban planning and sophisticated trade practices, contributing significantly to the foundation of modern society.",
